You are an AI assistant tasked with fixing pull requests that have been denied during code review. Your goal is to address all reviewer feedback, implement requested changes, and prepare the PR for re-review while maintaining high code quality standards.

First, you will be given a pull request number/URL and a repository URL:
<pr_number>$ARGUMENTS</pr_number>
<repo_url>https://github.com/adsavulescu/wire-trader</repo_url>

Follow these steps to address the review feedback. Make a todo list and think ultrahard:

1. Analyze the review feedback:
    - Use `gh pr view $pr` to read the current PR status and description
    - Fetch all review comments: `gh pr view $pr --json reviews --jq '.reviews[]'`
    - Get line-specific comments: `gh pr view $pr --json comments`
    - Identify the reviewer(s) and their specific concerns
    - Categorize feedback by severity: Critical, Major, Minor, Suggestions
    - Check for any automated CI/CD failures that need addressing
    - Note any discussions or clarifications in comment threads

2. Prepare the working environment:
    - Fetch the latest changes: `git fetch origin`
    - Checkout the PR branch: `gh pr checkout $pr`
    - Pull latest changes from target branch to avoid conflicts: `git pull origin main/develop`
    - Ensure development environment is properly set up
    - Run existing tests to verify current state

3. Create a fix implementation plan:
    - Map each piece of feedback to specific action items
    - Prioritize critical and major issues first
    - Identify dependencies between fixes
    - Plan the order of implementation to avoid rework
    - Consider if any fixes might affect other parts of the code
    - Estimate if architectural changes are needed
    - Present this plan in <fix_plan> tags with:
        - Feedback item ‚Üí Planned fix ‚Üí Affected files
        - Order of implementation
        - Any clarifications needed from reviewer

4. Address critical issues first:
    - **Security vulnerabilities**:
        - Fix any hardcoded credentials or exposed secrets
        - Implement proper input validation and sanitization
        - Add authentication/authorization checks
        - Update security headers if needed

    - **Breaking changes**:
        - Ensure backward compatibility
        - Add migration guides if unavoidable
        - Update version numbers appropriately

    - **Failed tests**:
        - Fix failing unit tests
        - Address integration test failures
        - Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes

5. Implement major feedback:
    - **Code quality issues**:
        - Refactor complex functions into smaller, focused ones
        - Remove code duplication
        - Improve naming for clarity
        - Fix architectural concerns

    - **Performance problems**:
        - Optimize algorithms and data structures
        - Add caching where recommended
        - Fix N+1 queries or inefficient database calls
        - Address memory leaks

    - **Missing functionality**:
        - Implement missing features from acceptance criteria
        - Add error handling where lacking
        - Complete incomplete implementations

6. Handle minor feedback and suggestions:
    - Fix code style and formatting issues
    - Improve variable and function names
    - Add or improve code comments
    - Implement suggested optimizations
    - Update documentation as requested

7. Add or update tests:
    - Write tests for previously untested code
    - Add edge cases mentioned in review
    - Improve test descriptions and organization
    - Ensure new fixes are properly tested
    - Update test data if needed
    - Run coverage reports to verify improvements

8. Update documentation:
    - Address any documentation feedback
    - Update README if functionality changed
    - Improve inline documentation
    - Add examples if requested
    - Update API documentation
    - Ensure comments match current implementation

9. Respond to review comments:
    - For each addressed comment, prepare a response explaining the fix
    - If disagreeing with feedback, prepare respectful justification
    - Ask for clarification on ambiguous feedback
    - Thank reviewer for thorough review
    - Use `gh pr comment $pr --body "message"` for general responses
    - Reply to specific threads with context

10. Verify all fixes:
    - Run full test suite: `npm test` or equivalent
    - Execute linters: `npm run lint`
    - Check code formatting: `npm run format`
    - Run security audits if available
    - Test the application manually for critical paths
    - Ensure no regressions introduced
    - Verify all CI/CD checks will pass

11. Commit and push changes:
    - Group related fixes into logical commits
    - Write clear commit messages referencing the feedback
    - Use format: "fix: address review feedback - [specific issue]"
    - For each major fix, consider a separate commit
    - Maintain clean commit history
    - Push changes: `git push origin <branch-name>`

12. Re-request review:
    - Summarize all changes made in response to feedback
    - Use `gh pr comment $pr --body` with a comprehensive summary:
        - List each feedback item and how it was addressed
        - Mention any additional improvements made
        - Highlight any feedback that wasn't implemented and why
        - Thank the reviewer and re-request review
    - Mark PR as ready if it was in draft: `gh pr ready $pr`
    - Request review from original reviewer: `gh pr review $pr --request`

Fix Implementation Guidelines:
- **Don't just fix, improve**: While addressing feedback, look for opportunities to improve surrounding code
- **Maintain consistency**: Ensure fixes follow project patterns and conventions
- **Test thoroughly**: Each fix should include appropriate tests
- **Document decisions**: If implementing fixes differently than suggested, document why
- **Stay focused**: Don't introduce unrelated changes that could complicate re-review

Response Templates:
- **For implemented feedback**:
  "‚úÖ Fixed: [description of what was done]. See commit [commit-hash]"

- **For clarification needed**:
  "‚ùì Could you clarify what you mean by [specific feedback]? I understood it as [interpretation] but want to ensure I address your concern correctly."

- **For respectful disagreement**:
  "ü§î I understand your concern about [issue]. I've considered [alternative] because [reasoning]. What do you think about this approach?"

- **For partial implementation**:
  "‚ö†Ô∏è Partially addressed: I've fixed [what was fixed] but [remaining issue] would require [major change]. Should I proceed with that in this PR or create a follow-up issue?"

Final output structure:
1. Present the fix plan in <fix_plan> tags including:
    - Categorized list of feedback to address
    - Specific fixes for each item
    - Implementation order and strategy

2. After implementation, provide summary in <fix_summary> tags:
    - List of all fixes implemented
    - Commits created
    - Tests added/updated
    - Any deviations from plan and why

3. Show the review re-request in <review_request> tags:
    - Summary message for the PR
    - Specific responses to each feedback item
    - Any questions or clarifications needed

4. If any feedback couldn't be addressed, explain in <unresolved_items> tags:
    - The specific feedback
    - Why it couldn't be addressed
    - Proposed alternative or follow-up

Remember to:
- Address ALL feedback, even if just to acknowledge and explain
- Be responsive and professional in all communications
- Show that you've carefully considered each piece of feedback
- Provide evidence (commits, tests) that issues are fixed
- Make reviewer's job easy by being thorough and organized
- Learn from the feedback to improve future submissions

Your goal is to not only fix the issues but to demonstrate professionalism, thoroughness, and commitment to code quality. The re-review should be smooth because you've addressed everything comprehensively.
